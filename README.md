Testing Pages

## Purpose of this repository
This repository is intended to be a point of access for a student that has difficulty accessing Geography Map quizzes. Since the student is used to using their resources to navigate webpages, I tried to design the site to be easily compatible with them. For example, Quiz 7 and later quizzes implements "user-select: all" so it is easier for the text to be selected to be read by the screan reader software. Some items have descriptive text before them to ensure that the student knows the context, for example "Selected Location: \[text description of location]".
I reworked the javascipt at map 9, so the previous quizzes are not linked in index.html. As I am doing this work from a laptop provided by my job, I cannot mass delete the previous quizzes, so they are included in the repository. I intend to update the old quizzes, but they will remain untouched for the near future.
