Testing Pages

## Purpose of this repository
This repository is intended to be a point of access for a student that has difficulty accessing Geography Map quizzes. Since the student is used to using their resources to navigate webpages, I tried to design the site to be easily compatible with them. For example, Quiz 7 and later quizzes implements "user-select: all" so it is easier for the text to be selected to be read by the screan reader software. Some items have descriptive text before them to ensure that the student knows the context, for example "Selected Location: \[text description of location]".
