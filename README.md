Testing Pages

## Purpose of this repository
I am a sepecial education paraprofessional, and I made this website to help a visually impaired student access geography quizzes in their World History course. The previous method was printing out sections of the map onto multiple sheets of paper, coloring the locations of interest, and taping the sheets together to form a large, foldable map. While serviceable, that method had large drawbacks. The map, the Brailled questions, the answer sheet(s), and other materials turned a one paged assignment into a sizeable packet. Preparation of those materials took a large amount of time, and the number of sheets would be difficult for the student to manage at times.


### Benefits
This webpage method allows several benefits that greatly improve the student's process. 
- With Github Pages, the quizzes are available to the student wherever they have internet access. 
- Through Photopea.com and Javascript, the locations on the map are selectable which helps to easily show what map items the identifying letters are associated with.
- Through the student's screenreading software, the question text from the quiz and the location descriptions from me can be heard instead of read.

### Sources
The quizzes and maps are from the course associated with Prentice Hall's World History textbook; its 13-digit ISBN is 978-0-13-365191-1. The base map images were scanned from the worksheets, and the colored reference maps were downloaded from bookshare.org's digital version of the textbook.

## Other
If there are ever any unecesary files in this repository, they are likely not deleted as my work comupter's permissions only allow me to access the repository through github.com, and the website only allows me to delete files individually. If you wish to contact me about this repository, I can be reached at wtarmstong@sps.mail.org as long as I am still employed here as a paraprofessional.
