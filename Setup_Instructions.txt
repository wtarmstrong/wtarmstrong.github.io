To setup files for a new quiz, there are # steps.
- Prep: Have access to the quiz's PDF file and complete the quiz.
1. Create file location for the new quiz
2. Edit the "quiz_#.html" and "quiz_#.js" files
3. Create images for the base map and the locations
4. Edit the "index.html" file to include the new quiz
5. Upload the "Quiz_#" folder and the "index.html" file to https://github.com/wtarmstrong/wtarmstrong.github.io

For more precise instruction:

1. Create file location for the new quiz
  A. If you do not have access to the "Quiz_0 (Template)" folder, then a copy can be accessed from "https://github.com/wtarmstrong/wtarmstrong.github.io". You can either download the whole repository as a ZIP file or you can manually access the individual files by clicking the "Quiz_0 (Template)" folder, then the file you are interested in, then copy&paste-ing into a blank file.
  B. Create a new folder for the new quiz. I use the simple naming scheme of "Quiz_#", but you can use whatever method you want as long as you properly refence it when you make changes to the "index.HTML" file.
  C. Make a copy of the contents in the "Quiz 0 (Template)" folder and save them in the new folder.
  D. Rename "quiz_#.html" and "quiz_#.js" by replacing the # with the quiz number.

2. Edit the "quiz_#.html" and "quiz_#.js" files
  A. Open "quiz_#.html" in an editor. I use Notepad++, but any should work, even Notepad.
  B. Towards the bottom of the file, change "<script src="quiz_#.js"></script>" by replacing the #.
  C. Open "quiz_#.js" in an editor.
  D. This file is where the most changes occur. Enter the necesarry information for each item.
    - Note: The image dimensions won't be available until you create the "Base Map.png" file.
  E. Save and close both files.

3. Create images for the base map and the locations
  - These steps will probably take some time; it will be faster the more familiar you are with creating images.
  A. Use a screenshot to capture the map from the quiz. Save the image as "Base Map.png".
  B. Using Photoshop (or Photopea like me because $), open the "Base Map.png" file.
  C. Create PNG files for each location on the quiz.
    - How you do this is up to you, but I'll list my steps here.
    1. Create three Layer Folders named "Whiteout", "Locations", and "Labels".
      - The order should be Labels, Locations, Whiteout, Base Map.
    2. In the "Whiteout" folder, create 11 layers, 1 for each location plus 1 for general touchups. Use the Brush tool with white coloring to whiteout the labels of each location. This allows me to make clear labels and reposition them if necessary.
    3. In the "Labels" folder, create a Text layer for each Letter on the map (A through J). If the letter represents a city, add another layer and use the brush tool or circle shape tool to add a black circle over the city marker.
    4. In the "Locations" folder, create a Shape by using the Pen tool to show each location's area. If the location is a city, make a box around the label and the dot.
    5. Set each shape in the label folder to have a Bright Yellow fill and a noticeable (but not massive) solid, black border.
    6. Create PNGs for each location by toggling off every layer except for the Location and the Label (and the city dot if applicable). Then use File > Export As > PNG to create the image for each location.
    7. Rename each file to follow the pattern of "_ Selected.png". (e.g. the image for A would be "A Selected.png".)
  D.  Move each of these files (there should be 10) and the "Base Map.png" file to the "Images" folder in the new "Quiz_#" folder.

4. Edit the "index.html" file to include the new quiz
  A. Copy&Paste the previous quiz items into the past quiz area
  B. Edit the names and file locations to reflect the new quiz

5. Upload the "Quiz_#" folder and the "index.html" file to https://github.com/wtarmstrong/wtarmstrong.github.io
